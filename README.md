# ðŸ“’ PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Many organizations have their own system to record their income and expenses, which they feel is the main key point of their business progress. It is good habit for a person to record daily expenses and earning but due to unawareness and lack of proper applications to suit their privacy, lacking decision making capacity people are using traditional note keeping methods to do so. Due to lack of a complete tracking system, there is a 2 constant overload to rely on the daily entry of the expenditure and total estimation till the end of the month.
In this project, we are creating a cloud application, based on python,flask,ibm db2,etc..,
